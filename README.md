# timesheet-manager
Add projects/tasks and their working times and generate reports from it

The main goal of this project is to create a simple but effective and useful web application to record working time. It can use any freelancers for their time and material based projects. It could be a multi user system with more complex functions but I currently focus on a simple single use case. The backend is Slim PHP Framework + mysql database and PHP Unit Tests the frontend is VUE js framework. See more on the wiki pages.
